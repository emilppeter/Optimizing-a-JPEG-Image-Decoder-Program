# Optimizing-a-JPEG-Image-Decoder-Program-on-FRDM-KL25Z-Board

A program to decode JPEG image stored in the memory and to display it on a 320x240 LCD screen ,using ARM Cortex M0+ based FRDM-KL25Z board, is optimized to obtain a target execution time of 435ms.The effect of each optimization on the execution time of the code is studied and the optimization with best improvement/development time was found.The execution profile of the code is studied using a profiler tool.Execution time for each optimization was analyzed as a function of development time. An execution time of 431ms was obtained after 7 optimizations.
